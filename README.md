You will see the new transaction in the pool (this is all off-chain):

(You'll notice you don't need ⛽️gas to sign transactions.)

> Execute the transction to transfer the funds:

(You might need to trigger a new block by sending yourself some faucet funds or something. HartHat blocks only get mined when there is a transaction.)

💼 Edit your deployment script `01_deploy_meta_multi_sig_wallet_contract.ts` in `packages/hardhat-ts/deploy`

🔏 Edit your contracts form, `MetaMultiSigWallet.sol` in `packages/hardhat-ts/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend in `packages/vite-app-ts/src/app/main`

## ⚔️ Side Quests

#### 🐟 Create custom signer roles for your Wallet
You may not want every signer to create new transfers, only allow them to sign existing transactions or a mega-admin role who will be able to veto any transaction.

#### 😎 Integrate this MultiSig wallet into other branches like nifty-ink  
Make a MultiSig wallet to store your precious doodle-NFTs!?

## 📡 Deploy the wallet!

🛰 Ready to deploy to a testnet?


📡 Edit the `defaultNetwork` to [your choice of public EVM networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/) in `packages/hardhat-ts/hardhat.config.ts`


### 🔶 Infura

🚔 Traffic to your url might break the [Infura](https://infura.io/) rate limit, edit your key: `constants.ts` in `packages/vite-app-ts/src/models/constants`

👩‍🚀 You will want to run `yarn account` to see if you have a **deployer address**

🔐 If you don't have one, run `yarn generate` to create a mnemonic and save it locally for deploying.

🛰 Use an [instantwallet.io](https://instantwallet.io) to fund your **deployer address** (run `yarn account` again to view balances)

📡 Edit the `export const targetNetworkInfo: TNetworkInfo = NETWORKS.localhost;` to [your choice of public EVM networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/) in `packages/vite-app-ts/src/config/providersConfig.ts`

> 🚀 Run `yarn deploy` to deploy to your public network of choice (😅 wherever you can get ⛽️ gas)

🔬 Inspect the block explorer for the network you deployed to... make sure your contract is there.

👮 Your contract source needs to be **verified**... (source code publicly available on the block explorer)

---

### ⛳️ **Checkpoint 8: 📜 Contract Verification**

Update the api-key in packages/hardhat-ts/package.json file. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

> Now you are ready to run the `yarn verify --network your_network` command to verify your contracts on etherscan 🛰
